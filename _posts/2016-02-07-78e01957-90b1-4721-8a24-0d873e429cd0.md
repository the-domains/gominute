Do you ever wonder what it would be like to have no fear of food or weight gain? Do you want to speed up your metabolism and change your life today, starting with your next meal? People are talking about this method on CNN, on the web and everywhere you go. The value we provide over books or word-of-mouth, is the FAST start (you next meal) and the support provided. Listen as you eat to the breakfast, lunch, and dinner recordings and learn within a single meal how to apply the method. Sooner or later, you will know that the GoMinute Eating Method is the only solution to the lifelong battle with weight.

Isn't it ABOUT TIME you stopped the cycle and started living again?
